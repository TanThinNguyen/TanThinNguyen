I am a graduate Computer Science student at HCM University of Science. My research interest are Digital Image Processing (including medical images), Computer Vision, Data Science and their applications. I have knowledge and work experience in research and development in Computer Vision area. 

I learn new knowledge every day. For any problem, I always try my best to understand the key concept of the method and why it works. In my opinion, I think the answer to the question of why is more essential than what, and itâ€™s hard to find out that answer of course. 

In the future, my goal is to get a research scholarship to study abroad in the Artificial Inteligence field.
